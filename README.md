npipe
=====

A Windows named pipe implementation written in pure Go.

See documentation at http://godoc.org/github.com/natefinch/npipe

Written for Go 1.1.

### Notes

Deadlines for reading/writing to the connection are only functional in Windows Vista/Server 2008 and above, due to limitations with the Windows API.


### How to Build

The z files contain new syscalls that don't exist in the standard library.

They are generated by running

$gosource/src/pkg/syscall/mksyscall_windows.pl npipe_windows.go > znpipe_windows_amd64.go
$gosource/src/pkg/syscall/mksyscall_windows.pl -l32 npipe_windows.go > znpipe_windows_386.go

Otherwise it's a normal Go package.
